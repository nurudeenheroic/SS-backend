 * Blocks requests while the underlying Soroban contract is paused.
 *
 * When contracts are paused on-chain — during a security investigation, say —
 * any funding, investment or settlement call the API accepts would fail at
 * submission time anyway, after the user has already committed to it. Rejecting
 * up front with a 503 is both faster and clearer than letting the request reach
 * the chain and bounce.
 *
 * 503 rather than 403: this is a temporary, whole-system condition the caller
 * can retry out of, not a permission problem with their request.
 *
 * Read-only endpoints should not use this guard. Browsing the marketplace
 * during a pause is harmless, and blocking it would hide the state of the
 * system from the people who need to see it.

/**
 * Issue #206: the admin invoice-reject endpoint must store the rejection
 * reason on the invoice record, transition its status to REJECTED, and
 * notify the seller.
 *
 * This is new functionality: prior to this change there was no invoice
 * reject path at all (only KYC approve/reject existed under
 * src/routes/admin/). This test exercises the new
 * `InvoiceService.rejectInvoice` method — the same layer
 * src/routes/admin/reject-invoice.ts delegates to — via an in-memory
 * repository and a fake notification sink, following this repo's existing
 * integration test convention (see invoice-draft-update.integration.test.ts,
 * notification-mark-read.integration.test.ts).
 *
 * Caveat (disclosed in the PR): this codebase has no role-based user/admin
 * model. The admin surface (approve-kyc, reject-kyc, and now reject-invoice)
 * is gated purely by a static `x-admin-key` header at the route layer
 * (see reject-invoice.ts), matching its sibling endpoints exactly. A
 * missing/incorrect key yields 401 there, not the 403 a full role-based
 * scheme might return for an authenticated-but-non-admin caller. That
 * route-layer check is exercised directly below; `InvoiceService.rejectInvoice`
 * itself (tested here) assumes the caller has already been authorized.

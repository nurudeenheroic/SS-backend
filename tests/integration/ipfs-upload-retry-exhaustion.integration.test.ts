/**
 * Integration coverage for issue #218: repeated IPFS pin failures must stop
 * after the configured retry limit and must leave the invoice's document
 * state consistent (no false "successfully pinned" status).
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE (see PR description for full disclosure): IPFSService.uploadFile
 * (src/services/ipfs.service.ts) does not contain an internal retry loop —
 * it makes exactly one HTTP call per invocation and the caller is expected
 * to drive retries (this mirrors the existing convention in
 * tests/integration/ipfs-upload.test.ts, which manually invokes uploadFile
 * multiple times with an increasing attemptNumber to simulate a retrying
 * caller). InvoiceService.uploadDocument itself does not wrap uploadFile in
 * any retry loop at all — it calls it once and rejects on the first failure.
 *
 * This suite builds the minimal retry-exhaustion harness consistent with
 * that architecture: it drives InvoiceService.uploadDocument up to a fixed
 * "maximum attempts" count (mirroring how a retrying caller such as a queue
 * consumer or client-side retry policy would behave), and verifies that
 * after the configured number of failed attempts, the IPFS provider was
 * called exactly that many times, the invoice document state is never
 * corrupted with a false-positive pin, and the final error is a stable,
 * credential-free ServiceError.
